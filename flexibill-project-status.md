# FlexiBill Project Status

## Overview

This document outlines the current state of the FlexiBill project, what has been completed, what is in progress, and what remains to be done for both Phase 1 and Phase 2 to be considered 100% complete. This document is specifically tailored for Anthropic Claude 3.7 Sonnet to continue development with a fresh context window.

## Current Project Structure

The project follows a typical modern web application architecture with:
- Backend (Node.js/TypeScript)
- Mobile app (React Native)
- Shared types between frontend and backend

## What Has Been Completed

### Backend
- Basic server setup with Express
- Database configuration and connection
- Entity definitions (User, Account, Bill, Transaction)
- API routes structure
- Authentication service and routes
- Plaid integration service
- Transaction service
- Bill service
- AI recommendation service

### Mobile App
- Basic app structure and navigation
- Authentication screen with login/register functionality
- API service for communication with backend
- Plaid service for bank account integration
- Started implementing LinkAccountScreen

### Shared
- Type definitions for all entities
- Shared interfaces between frontend and backend

## What Was In Progress

I was in the middle of implementing the Plaid integration in the mobile app:

1. Created a PlaidService.ts file to handle Plaid-specific API calls
2. Updated the LinkAccountScreen to use our PlaidService
3. Was fixing TypeScript errors related to the react-native-plaid-link-sdk integration

The specific issue I was working on was resolving TypeScript errors in the LinkAccountScreen.tsx file:
- Module '"react-native-plaid-link-sdk"' has no exported member 'createPlaidLink'
- Parameter 'success' implicitly has an 'any' type
- Parameter 'exit' implicitly has an 'any' type
- Parameter 'event' implicitly has an 'any' type

## Phase 1 Completion Status: ~75%

Phase 1 focuses on the core functionality of the app:

### Completed in Phase 1:
- Backend API structure
- Database setup
- Authentication flow
- Basic mobile app structure
- Type definitions

### Remaining for Phase 1 (25%):
1. **Fix Plaid Integration Issues**:
   - Resolve TypeScript errors in LinkAccountScreen
   - Ensure proper communication with backend Plaid routes
   - Test the full Plaid linking flow

2. **Complete Home Screen Implementation**:
   - Display linked accounts
   - Show transaction summary
   - Basic bill management UI

3. **Bills Screen Implementation**:
   - List all bills
   - Add/edit/delete bills
   - Set bill due dates

4. **Settings Screen Implementation**:
   - User profile management
   - App preferences
   - Data sharing options

5. **Testing and Debugging**:
   - End-to-end testing of core flows
   - Fix any bugs in the authentication and account linking processes

## Phase 2 Completion Status: ~40%

Phase 2 focuses on advanced features and AI integration:

### Completed in Phase 2:
- AI recommendation service structure
- Bill recommendation entity
- Data sharing types and models

### Remaining for Phase 2 (60%):
1. **AI Recommendations Implementation**:
   - Complete AIRecommendationsScreen
   - Implement bill due date change suggestions
   - Create cash flow optimization algorithms

2. **Bill Due Date Change Automation**:
   - Implement request templates for different bill providers
   - Create automation for sending change requests
   - Track status of change requests

3. **Advanced Analytics**:
   - Spending patterns visualization
   - Cash flow forecasting
   - Bill payment history

4. **Data Sharing Features**:
   - Implement sliding-scale data sharing model
   - Create anonymization processes
   - Set up subscription discount based on sharing level

5. **Premium Features**:
   - Implement subscription management
   - Gate premium features appropriately
   - Payment processing integration

6. **Notifications System**:
   - Bill due reminders
   - Low balance alerts
   - AI recommendation notifications

## Next Immediate Steps

1. Fix the Plaid integration in the mobile app:
   - Check the correct imports and types for react-native-plaid-link-sdk v12.0.3
   - Update the LinkAccountScreen with proper TypeScript types
   - Test the account linking flow

2. Implement the HomeScreen to display linked accounts and transactions:
   - Create UI components for account cards
   - Implement transaction list with filtering
   - Add summary statistics (total balance, upcoming bills)

3. Complete the BillsScreen implementation:
   - Create bill list UI
   - Implement bill creation/editing forms
   - Add due date selection and reminder settings

## Instructions for Claude 3.7 Sonnet

When continuing this project, please follow these guidelines:

1. **Start with fixing the Plaid integration**:
   - The LinkAccountScreen needs proper TypeScript types for react-native-plaid-link-sdk v12.0.3
   - Check the package documentation or GitHub repository for the correct API
   - Implement proper error handling for the Plaid linking process

2. **Follow the established patterns**:
   - Services for API communication
   - Strong typing for all components and functions
   - Consistent error handling
   - Checkpoint creation after completing major features

3. **Testing approach**:
   - Test each component individually
   - Create integration tests for critical flows
   - Use the checkpoint system to save progress

4. **Code organization**:
   - Keep related functionality in the same files
   - Use the shared types for consistency
   - Follow the established naming conventions

5. **Documentation**:
   - Add comments for complex logic
   - Update README files as needed
   - Document API endpoints and their parameters

## Conclusion

The FlexiBill project has made significant progress in both Phase 1 and Phase 2, with the core structure and many key components already implemented. The immediate focus should be on completing the Plaid integration and the remaining screens for Phase 1, followed by the advanced features in Phase 2.

This document should provide sufficient context to continue development with a fresh context window, focusing on the immediate next steps while keeping the overall project goals in mind.
