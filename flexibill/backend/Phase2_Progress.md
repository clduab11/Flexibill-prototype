# FlexiBill Phase 2 Progress Report

This document summarizes the progress made on Phase 2 of the FlexiBill project, outlines the completed tasks, and details the remaining work required for full implementation.

## Completed Tasks

The following tasks have been completed as part of the initial Phase 2 implementation:

1.  **Project Setup and Configuration:**
    *   Created a `shared` directory for common types and utilities.
    *   Set up TypeScript configuration (`tsconfig.json`) for both the backend and shared directories, including path aliases for easier imports.
    *   Installed necessary dependencies, including `plaid`, `uuid`, `express`, `body-parser`, `dotenv`, `cors`, `express-validator`, `typeorm`, `pg`, `@supabase/supabase-js`, `openai`, and various testing and linting libraries.
    *   Configured ESLint, Prettier, and Jest for code quality and testing.
    *   Created `.env.example` file with necessary environment variables.
    *   Set up VS Code settings for consistent development environment.
    *   Created Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml for containerized development.
    *   Created a helper script (`docker-dev.sh`) for managing Docker operations.
    *   Created database initialization scripts (`initSchema.sql`, `seedData.sql`, `initDb.sh`).

2.  **Shared Types:**
    *   Defined TypeScript interfaces and types for `User`, `Account`, `Bill`, `BillRecommendation`, `Transaction`, `CashFlowAnalysis`, and other related data structures in the `shared/types` directory.  These types are used across both the backend and mobile applications.

3.  **Backend Services:**
    *   **PlaidService:** Implemented the `PlaidService` to interact with the Plaid API. This includes:
        *   `createLinkToken`: Generates a Plaid Link token for initializing the Plaid Link flow.
        *   `exchangePublicToken`: Exchanges a public token (received from Plaid Link) for a Plaid access token.
        *   `syncTransactions`: Fetches transactions for a linked account. (Placeholder implementation for now)
        *   `handleWebhook`: Handles Plaid webhook events. (Placeholder implementation for now)
    *   **AIService:** Implemented the `AIService` to interact with the OpenAI API. This includes:
        *   `generateBillRecommendations`: Generates bill payment recommendations. (Placeholder implementation)
        *   `analyzeCashFlow`: Performs cash flow analysis. (Placeholder implementation)
        *   `detectSavingsOpportunities`: Identifies potential savings opportunities. (Placeholder implementation)
        *   Prompt creation methods for each AI function.
    *   **BillService:** Implemented the `BillService` to manage bill-related operations. This includes:
        *   `createBill`, `getBill`, `updateBill`, `deleteBill`, `getUserBills`
        *   `getBillsByDateRange`, `getBillsForMonth`, `getUpcomingBills`, `getOverdueBills`
        *   `optimizeBillSchedule` (Placeholder implementation)
        *   `validateBill` (for data validation)
    *   **TransactionService:** Implemented the `TransactionService` to manage transaction-related operations. This includes:
        *   `getTransactions`: Retrieves transactions with filtering.
        *   `updateTransactionTags`: Updates tags for a transaction.
        *   `detectRecurringTransactions`: Identifies recurring transactions.
        *   `categorizeTransactions`: Assigns categories to transactions.
        *   `getTransactionSummary`: Generates a summary of transactions. (Placeholder implementation)
        *   `getTransactionAnalysis`: Performs transaction analysis. (Placeholder implementation)
        *   Helper methods for grouping and analyzing transactions.
    *   **DatabaseService:** Implemented a `DatabaseService` to manage the connection to the Supabase database and provide a simplified interface for database operations.  This replaces the initial mock database.
    *   **Error Handling:** Created custom error classes (`DatabaseError`, `ConnectionError`, `EntityError`, etc.) for consistent error handling.

4.  **API Routes:**
    *   Created API routes for Plaid integration (`plaidRoutes.ts`), bill management (`billRoutes.ts`), AI services (`aiRoutes.ts`), and transaction management (`transactionRoutes.ts`).
    *   Implemented basic request validation using `express-validator`.
    *   Added placeholder authentication middleware (`authMiddleware.ts`).
    *   Used a consistent response format with the `APIResponse` utility.

5.  **Entities (TypeORM):**
    *   Defined TypeORM entities for `User`, `Account`, `Bill`, and `BillRecommendation`, mirroring the data models.
    *   Established relationships between entities.

6.  **Testing:**
    *   Created Jest configuration (`jest.config.js`).
    *   Set up test utilities (`src/db/testutils.ts` and `src/test/setupTests.ts`).
    *   Implemented basic tests for the `DatabaseService` and `TransactionService`.

7.  **Mobile App (Initial Integration):**
    *   Installed the `react-native-plaid-link-sdk`.
    *   Modified the `LinkAccountScreen.tsx` to integrate with Plaid Link, including fetching a link token and handling the `onSuccess`, `onExit`, and `onEvent` callbacks.  This includes making network requests to the backend.

## Remaining Tasks (Phase 2)

## Summary

Significant progress has been made on the backend, with the core infrastructure and services in place. The Plaid Link integration has been started in the mobile app. The next steps involve completing the backend logic, fully integrating the Plaid Link flow, implementing the remaining features, and thoroughly testing the application. The focus will be on connecting to Supabase, implementing authentication, and completing the core functionality of the services.
